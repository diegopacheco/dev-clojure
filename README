Purpose:
--------

This group is focused on learning Clojure. Our goal is create a small Java BANK system that calls
some clojure functions to do some math processing with huge concurrency using STM.

WHY Clojure ?
-------------

- Java has lots and lots synatx obesity
- OOP is not the holly grail and don't awnser all questions
- Clojure works really well with concurrency, read STM
- Clojure you have one function for 10 types of data, java you have 10 to 10
- Clojure is Functional, like LISP BUT much better
- Clojrue Runs on the JVM, so you can use all java frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, etc...
- Work with Clojrue will make you a better java developer
- Open your mind, new paradigms
- Clojure enables you think more about the problemn rather than in the syntax, frameworks, JEE, other heavy craps...
- Twitter is using Clojure in production
- Horoku supports Clojures at the CLOUD => http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/7/5/clojure_on_heroku/
